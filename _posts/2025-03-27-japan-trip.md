Last year marked my first trip to Japan, something I'd wanted to do for a *very* long time. I've been studying Japanese for a few years and grew up playing Japanese games, so the visit was long overdue. I only held off because I rarely travelled, but then the perfect opportunity landed in my lap - two globe-trotting friends asked me to tag along. They'd visited before and already cooked up an itinerary, so I just needed to chill out and follow their lead. That was perfect for me - I could rest easy knowing I wouldn't fall off a cliff 10 seconds into the trip. I learned the cities are extremely tourist-friendly after arriving, but I still needed an extra push to take the plunge. I appreciate my buddies for that.

The trip lasted two weeks. We spent the first half in the capital city of Tokyo and the second in Osaka, a smaller city further inland. We visited a bunch of Shinto and Buddhist shrines along the way, collecting stamps in a small book we bought. Each shrine has a unique stamp to commemorate your trip, encouraging people to travel far and wide. We collected about 10 stamps which made for an awesome souvenir.

The food was a major highlight for me. Thanks to the exchange rate at the time, we were able to eat amazing food at insanely low prices. Sushi was especially cheap compared to back home - it's common food and priced accordingly (not the exotic delicacy we overpay for in the States). We became regulars at a sushi bar where you stand at the counter and order directly from the chef. Getting recognized by the staff after a few visits was a cool experience.

Against all odds, my favorite meal of the trip wasn't sushi. It was a special meal called "teishoku" (定食) that's basically a big collection of side dishes. You order from a list of options like miso soup, edamame, ginger, and tempura, with everything laid out on a big platter. This was a great way to find new foods and try them out, even the intimidating ones like [nattō][natto] (sticky, fermented soybeans). My favorite part was combining everything into a single bite and and just letting the flavors go wild. Like the sushi bar, our favorite teishoku place was tiny, easily missed, and run by a crew of passionate people. We learned that wandering down a random alleyway could reward you with some killer food.
