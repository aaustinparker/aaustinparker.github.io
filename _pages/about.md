Thanks for visiting my website! I'm Austin, a software developer from Los Angeles. I currently work as a full-stack developer on enterprise applications. I also develop passion projects on the side, hoping to use those self-taught skills professionally someday. While I plan on adding more content to the site, for now it's just a way to convince hiring managers that I'm not a bot. Heck yeah!

## Background
 I started coding back in my second year of college. I enrolled with no idea what I wanted to study, leaning toward history just because it was interesting. My mom "gently" suggested that I find a job with more financial stability, which I lazily acquiesced to. No way I was dying on that hill.
 
Then I got an amazing professor for Computer Science 101. After seeing his passion and finding my personal rhythm as a programmer, there was no way I could study anything else. I transferred out of liberal arts and slogged through my STEM requirements, surviving with minor trauma from weed-out classes like algorithms (I still see Big O in my nightmares). I eventually got a major in Computer Science and snagged a second in Sociology.

So here I am! I landed my first internship in web development and continued down that path. I've worked across the tech stack on a variety of projects, serving as a generalist most days and a specialist when required. I'm also learning skills like game development and Japanese to open more career avenues. Now that this website exists, I'll try to come up with some simple projects to show off.

## Values
1. Curiosity. Learn something new every day, even if it's just memorizing a flashcard. Always maintain a sense of forward momentum.
2. Flexibility. Avoid getting bogged down in routines that make the world seem smaller than it actually is. Try to meet new people and find new opportunities.
3. Resilience. Don't pretend failure doesn't matter. Reflect on it and bounce back stronger.
