Thanks for visiting my site! I'm Austin, a software developer from Los Angeles. I currently work as a full-stack developer on enterprise applications. I also develop all sorts of passion projects on the side, hoping to use those self-taught skills professionally someday. While I plan on adding more content to the site, for now it's mostly a way to reassure hiring managers that I'm a real person and not a bot! Woo!

## Background
 I started coding 10 years ago during my second year of college. I enrolled with zero idea what I wanted to study, leaning toward history just because I thought it was interesting. My mom, doing her best impression of a [helicopter parent][helicopter], told me to find a job with more financial stability. I followed her advice while doing my best impression of a lazy college student.
 
Then I got an amazing professor for CompSci 101. After seeing his passion and discovering my own rhythm as a programmer, there was no way I could study anything else. I transferred out of liberal arts and slogged through my STEM requirements, surviving with only *slight* trauma from weed-out classes like algorithms (I still see Big O in my nightmares). I eventually got my major in Computer Science and snagged a second in Sociology just the beef up the ol' resume.

So here I am! I landed my first internship in web development and continued down that path. I've worked all across the stack on a wide range of projects, serving as a generalist most days but becoming a specialist when required. I'm also learning skills like game development and machine to open new career paths. Now that this website exists, I'll try cooking up some bite-sized projects to show off.

## Values
1. Curiosity. Learn something new every day, even if it's just memorizing a flashcard. Maintain a sense of forward momentum no matter what life throws at you.
2. Flexibility. Avoid getting bogged down in routines that make the world seem smaller than it actually is. Try to meet new people and find new opportunities.
3. Resilience. Don't pretend failure doesn't matter. Reflect on why it happened a come back better than before.
