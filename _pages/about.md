Thanks for visiting my website! I'm Austin, a software developer from Los Angeles. I currently work as a full-stack developer on enterprise applications. I also develop all sorts of passion projects on the side, hoping to use those self-taught skills professionally someday. While I plan on adding more content to the site, for now it's just a way to convince hiring managers that I'm a real person and not a bot! Huzzah!

## Background
 I started coding back in my second year of college. I enrolled with no idea what I wanted to study, leaning toward history just because I thought it was interesting. My mom helicoptered in and suggested I find a job with more financial security, which I lazily agreed to. I wasn't ready to die on that hill.
 
Then I got an amazing professor for CompSci 101. After seeing his passion and finding my own rhythm as a programmer, there was no way I could study anything else. I transferred out of liberal arts and slogged through my STEM requirements, surviving with light trauma from weed-out classes like algorithms (I still see Big O in my nightmares). I eventually got my major in Computer Science and snagged a second in Sociology.

So here I am! I landed my first internship in web development and continued down that path. I've worked all across the stack on a wide range of projects, serving as a generalist most days and a specialist when required. I'm also learning skills like game development and Japanese for more career options. Now that this website exists, I'll try to come up with bite-sized projects to show off.

## Values
1. Curiosity. Learn something new every day, even if it's just memorizing a flashcard. Always maintain a sense of forward momentum.
2. Flexibility. Avoid getting bogged down in routines that make the world seem smaller than it actually is. Try to meet new people and find new opportunities.
3. Resilience. Don't pretend failure doesn't matter. Reflect on it and come back better than before.
